# SmartEverything ST LSM6DS3 3D accelerometer, 3D gyroscope
----
This is a library for the ST LSM6DS3 component.

The LSM6DS3 is a system-in-package featuring a 3D digital linear acceleration sensor, a 3D
digital angular rate sensor

The LSM6DS3 has a linear acceleration full scale of ±2g/±4g/±8/±16 g and an angular rate of
±245/±500/±1000/±2000 dps.

Host control and result reading is performed using an I2C interface, no extra pin are required.

It was principally designed to work with the SmartEverything board, but could
be easily adapt and use on every Arduino and Arduino Certified boards.
